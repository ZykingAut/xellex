# Xellex

Xellex is a small 2D scroller and my first game I plan to finish. I am trying to finish this game within 1 year, that's because of school and motivation issues. The newest release can always be found [here](https://www.github.com/ZykingAut/xellex/releases).

## Description

The game's engine will be unity, since as i said I don't have the time nor the skill to make my own engine. The basic concept of the game will be a kind of reverse thingy. So while you play the game there will be actions to change the direction you are running. Maybe I will implement a sort of reverse time thing but I am unsure yet. But while you are in the reverse mode I plan on changing the controls so basically the whole playing gets reverted. The game won't have a good or special story, because I am very bad at making storys and I want it to be more focused on the playing and improving your mechanics. Sooner or later if the game gets more and more attention I plan on making a speedrun feature with a leaderboard. I am unsure about the graphics yet, but there won't be any high resolution stuff, maybe some polished art but i don't know yet.
